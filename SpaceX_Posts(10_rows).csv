Falcon 9 going supersonic https://t.co/Fla67xwxf3,2022-05-26 1:09:28,217286,11234,5,https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1529630765872467968
Activating Starlink â€¦,2022-09-23 18:30:18,188964,31409,2,https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1573379244268437504
This would be a super bad idea since stocks can swing wildly from one day to the next eg Snapchat dropping 43%. Tesla is ~40% below ATH! However eliminating estate tax dodges like GRATs would be good since probability of kids being effective stewards of capital is lower.,2022-05-27 0:19:26,3081,199,48,https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1529980564811534341
That's the plan unless it is damaged in testing. What really matters is that ship & booster production line is spooling up. Also each new ship & booster has incremental design improvements.,2022-10-24 13:39:48,3806,235,42,https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1584540160959860738

Starlink bandwidth varies a lot depending on user terminal density & time of day. That's why the long wait in some areas. Throughput is roughly linear with total V1 satellites in operation. V2 satellites are at least 5 times better (conservative estimate) than V1.,2022-07-18 14:17:12,3814,208,46,https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1549035564485070848
Electric power for booster & ship is needed even when engines aren't running & incremental power draw of TVC isn't too bad. We have local supercaps on each engine to deal with power spikes.,2022-07-15 2:03:17,3466,175,39,https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1547763701121294336
