The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.

Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.

Side boosters landing on droneships & center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.

Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be & will if BFR takes longer than expected.

That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.

Earth should be called Water. Our surface is 71% water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as it’s all land. Even when warmed up & water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about 2/3 land.

~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.

Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.

Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.

Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done.

SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight & thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok.

Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!

  - Plug in socket
  - Point at sky

Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.

Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!

That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume.

Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.

Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 & 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.

A fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc.

We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights.

Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.

Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.

The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point.

It’s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant & pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers & stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!

Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust.

The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC & differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever.

Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt).

Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. 

R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.

What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.

Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it’s less than 1% of the pain.

T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.

What has become absolutely clear is that the plethora of self-driving corner cases can only be solved with real-world optical intelligence. This is how humans designed the road system to work. 

Once you have that in silicon form, everything else is just icing on the cake.

If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.

A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year. 

Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.

There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. 

Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.

Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it’s not a gamechanger.

Agreed! We’re not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power.

BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. We learned a lot, but have already changed design to BN2. 

Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky.

Ascent phase, transition to horizontal & control during free fall were good. 

A (relatively) small CH4 leak led to fire on engine 2 & fried part of avionics, causing hard start attempting landing burn in CH4 turbopump. 

This is getting fixed 6 ways to Sunday.

Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal “glide” with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs).

Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). 

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. 

As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.

Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again.

Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.

Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full & can stabilize grid.

If Tesla owners are “conspiracy theorists”, then it would be fair to call them “advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers”. 

If that’s an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths …

Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building & launching rocket of that size is >>4X.

Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry >100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket.

L/D makes quite a big difference. We do care about lift for Starship much more than Dragon, as lower peak heating is needed for reusability of heat shield.

Dragon prefers high peak, low total heat load, as it is driven by tile heat pulse reaching bondline while under parachutes.

Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. This is basically Raptor 2.

Raptor Vacuum would be only variant. Tbd as to whether to commonize R-Vac with Raptor 2 (more thrust), keep same or tighten throat (more Isp). 

Adding 3 more R-Vac to ship with max Isp maybe …

Large pouch cells undergo significant volumetric changes at high state of charge.

Even so, fire risk is probably less than gasoline cars. There are over 200,000 combustion engine car fires every year in US alone. It’s literally in the name.

That’s arguably a security issue, but  allowing companies to use other payment options, especially for in-app purchases would be fair.

As soon as they allowed that, they would have to lower their fees.

As for the cost of reviewing apps for security, a fixed fee makes sense.

Indeed. Grid fin designs clearly work, but do they maximize payload? Good chance that they do not. 

Something with much more drag to reduce terminal velocity & so reduce landing propellant might have better performance. Not sure.

There is a reason no fully reusable orbital rocket has been built – it’s an insanely hard problem.

16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.

Without flaps & heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs don’t add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights.

However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 & has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.

Starship will be crushingly cost-effective for Earth orbit or moon missions as soon as it’s operational & rapid reuse is happening. 

Mars is a lot harder, because Earth & Mars only align every 26 months, so ship reuse is limited to ~dozen times over 25 to 30 year life of ship.

Btw, there’s a slight error with forward flap design. Moving section is needed for control, but passive section is counter-productive, as it pushes nose backwards. 

New design rotates fwd flaps more to leeward & further forward to improve moment arm. Maybe ~120 deg apart.

No, bottom static aero pushes engine section back, counteracting Starship’s low center of mass on reentry caused by the engine section. 

Aiming for 60 to 70 deg angle of attack during high heating portion of flight. Don’t want to reenter with engines blasted by plasma.

Our satellites launching in next few months have inter-satellite laser links, so no local downlink needed. Probably active in 4 to 6 months.

Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints, so data can go from say Sydney to London through space, which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber & shorter path. 

Also, no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!

There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth, but much less nickel. 

For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron.

Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles & aircraft.

Long chain hydrocarbons, like kerosene, have excellent volumetric energy density, but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen, which is CH4.

The regulatory process for approval to offer insurance is extremely slow & complex, varying considerably by state. 

Tesla is hoping to offer real-time (based on actual driving history) insurance in Texas next month.

Probably next year before we get approval in New York.

If tiles are not super thin, you get hot plasma “waterfalling” off edges of tiles, creating hotspots. 

That said, I’m not entirely convinced that this couldn’t be done with several overlapping scales of metal sheet with an insulator between scale armor & primary structure.

Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble! Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD. 

Our internal QA fleet didn’t see this, because cars are constantly in use, so very rarely enter power saving mode. Internal QA will obv test this case going forward.

Tentative plan is 98 & above starts uploading Friday afternoon next week.

If we see any concerns, uploads will pause while we investigate, so might take a few days before everyone with 98 safety gets beta 10.4.

10.4 improves left turns across fast traffic & stopping for gates.

True, although it will look clean with close out panels installed. 

Raptor 2 has significant improvements in every way, but a complete design overhaul is necessary for the engine that can actually make life multiplanetary. It won’t be called Raptor.

Tragically, it is not clear that the defense contractors can get to the moon for any amount of money. 

More than $200B has been spent on development of new US crewed space transport systems over past ~40 years, but only Dragon is flying. Development cost to NASA was <$2B.

Limiting factor for first launch is regulatory approval. Thereafter, fundamental issue is solving engine production.

If we are able to make life self-sustaining on Mars, we will have passed one of the greatest filters. That then sets us up to become interstellar.

Earth is ~4.5B years old, but life is still not multiplanetary and it is extremely uncertain how much time is left to become so.

LIDAR is a seductive local maximum. SpaceX designed & built them to dock with ISS.

However, the road system was designed to work with biological neural nets & eyes, so a general solution to self-driving necessarily will require silicon neural nets & cameras.

Updating software to reduce peak power consumption, so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighter.

Mobile roaming enabled, so phased array antenna can maintain signal while on moving vehicle.

Our primary challenge is affordability. Creating an expensive truck is relatively easy. 

If it is extremely hard to do so for Tesla, despite our much greater economies of scale & better technology, then it is damn near impossible for others.

We could’ve made a 600 mile Model S 12 months ago, but that would’ve made the product worse imo, as 99.9% of time you’d be carrying unneeded battery mass, which makes acceleration, handling & efficiency worse. Even our 400+ mile range car is more than almost anyone will use.
