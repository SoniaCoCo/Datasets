Replying to @Erdayastronaut Btw there’s a slight error with forward flap design. Moving section is needed for control but passive section is counter-productive as it pushes nose backwards.

Replying to @NASASpaceflight Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid.

Replying to @ErcXspace and @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5 so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant the primary cost.

Replying to @PPathole @thesheetztweetz and 4 others Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) & more ground stations are deployed. As we’re able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers legacy Internet latency will be zero.,2020-10-02T06:58:59.000Z,176,1876,45,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1311923618679607298

Replying to @Tenjin37151 @Space_Station and 9 others As described in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (great book) a linear accelerator would be great for the moon. Earth’s gravity is too high & atmosphere too dense for accelerators to be a good solution vs reusable boosters imo.,2021-11-10T17:16:16.000Z,175,2622,47,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1458483658071945223
Replying to @Teslarati Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering! The Crew Dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem.

Replying to @SamTwits @Erdayastronaut and 2 others Long chain hydrocarbons like kerosene have excellent volumetric energy density but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen which is CH4. Also easy to make & store CH4+O2 from CO2+H2O which are abundant on Mars.,2021-09-18T12:38:20.000Z,174,2458,47,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1439207158588088320
Replying to @jc_comrade Should be nationwide rollout by end of month. Note still limited by peak number of users in same area. This will improve as more satellites are launched.,2021-10-07T14:47:31.000Z,174,2488,30,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446125039447777282
Replying to @Erdayastronaut @i_gvf and @SciGuySpace Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small single engine turboprop plane. In the same way a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.,2020-06-11T09:39:54.000Z,173,2807,48,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1271014285402046464
Replying to @harrison_astro We can do that partially but detailed rocket technology is considered advanced weaponry (same tech as nuclear missiles) so there are more limitations than at Tesla,2021-10-17T03:40:44.000Z,173,3655,29,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1449581116789198855

Replying to @Astro_Elliott and @LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry >100 tons of payload it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. Aircraft for example have moved away from 747/A380 to 777 which has ~100 tons of payload.,2021-07-01T11:17:01.000Z,172,2897,51,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1410558052315639809
Replying to @tobyliiiiiiiiii and @Erdayastronaut There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel but not dangerous.

Replying to @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett and 2 others Intuitively it would seem so but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust & propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters & they’re already there,2021-02-05T02:44:05.000Z,172,5026,31,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357520341355159555
Replying to @Erdayastronaut and @robert_zubrin Unfortunately Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side but none required on leeward.

Replying to @NASASpaceflight Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise.,2020-08-24T22:10:21.000Z,172,3255,24,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1298019842356703232

Replying to @Teslarati Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights.,2019-08-09T01:02:03.000Z,171,4418,28,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1159630890026188800
Replying to @amywestervelt and @weinbergersa Yes because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that haven’t been unveiled yet.

Replying to @v_g_fischer and @mayemusk Yeah 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400.

Replying to @Erdayastronaut @dauqhx and @universal_sci Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough.

Replying to @elonmusk and @Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.,2019-01-23T15:09:55.000Z,147,1743,45,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1088091464909766656

Replying to @Erdayastronaut @C_Bass3d and 2 others It’s counter-intuitive but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant & pump-fed (light tanks) that it beats hot gas for the flip.

Replying to @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 and 2 others If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw as shown by this NASA density map. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris…,2019-05-27T06:52:28.000Z,136,1049,41,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1132902372458418176
Replying to @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight and 2 others The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now) so same thickness works for booster & ship for hoop stress.

Replying to @MatthewCable6 and @ErcXspace Just a guess but probably mid teens. Booster & stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors.

Replying to @elonmusk @SPEXcast and @SciGuySpace What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is.

Replying to @LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass 4X but difficulty of simultaneously building & launching rocket of that size is >>4X. In retrospect <9m diameter for Starship might have been wise.

Replying to @planet4589 and @DJSnM L/D makes quite a big difference. We do care about lift for Starship much more than Dragon as lower peak heating is needed for reusability of heat shield. Dragon prefers high peak low total heat load as it is driven by tile heat pulse reaching bondline while under parachutes.,2021-07-05T10:59:39.000Z,122,2340,54,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1412003232470081539
Replying to @Erdayastronaut and @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design but kerosene is suboptimal fuel no matter what you do. What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.,2020-11-17T18:28:52.000Z,122,2809,53,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1328767073506430977

Replying to @ludan27 @Erdayastronaut and 3 others Yes but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster & orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth due to deep gravity well & thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons & Mars.,2018-12-22T23:00:48.000Z,79,1119,47,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1076613555091234816

Replying to @_cgp and @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo provided everything holds together which is far from certain. However only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.,2019-02-11T02:50:09.000Z,78,1061,53,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1094790663646760961
Replying to @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut and @Cor_SPACE Just SX500 so far but we use many superalloys developed by others eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++ that would be helpful haha.

Replying to @SidewalkSciGuy @Erdayastronaut and 4 others Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium & carbon fiber which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9 moreover at high altitude it needs no heat shield not even paint.,2019-03-17T20:46:18.000Z,78,1132,49,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1107382673012486144

Replying to @bluemoondance74 and @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50 although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight especially on Super Heavy which is less sensitive to engine variation.

Replying to @Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer and @LanceUlanoff Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions.

Replying to @elonmusk @flcnhvy and 2 others Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false.

Replying to @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM and @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2 so if t is small you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms.

Replying to @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut and 2 others Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars production is over 99% of the problem.
