Some of the brightest objects in space are blazars—supermassive black holes feeding off material which can create two powerful jets of high-speed particles. A recent discovery using IXPE data solves a mystery 40 years in the works: https://t.co/ohy0vsiJfN #BlackHoleFriday https://t.co/D5VW6ae0ej,2022-11-25 17:06:20+00:00,4499,33,104,687,https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1596188547123449857,17,48,4499

We're working with @ESA to plan one of the most ambitious feats ever attempted in space—bringing a Mars sample to Earth. The Mars Sample Return campaign could help answer a question rovers alone cannot: Was there life on Mars? Here's how we plan to do it: https://t.co/vEqW0DJUlq https://t.co/Owoz2aHrKv,2022-11-22 15:08:22+00:00,6046,127,278,1083,https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1595071698826510337,15,57,6046
